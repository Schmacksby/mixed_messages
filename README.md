# mixed_messages
## Mixed Messages Portfolio Project Codecademy

This Project consists of two files containing quotes (taken from https://gist.github.com/awran5/355643af99164a61ae0f95c84206d151) and the mixed_messages.js.
Every time mixed_messages.js is called, a random number in the range of the quotes array is generated and the according quote is printed to the console.
